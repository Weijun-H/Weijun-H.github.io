				<p>Hi there, my name is Weijun Huang. I am a master student at <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark</a> (DTU), majoring in Human-centered Artificial Intelligence.</p>
<p>Life is like a circle. When I was a freshman, I thought my interest was design, and I had to work hard to switch from computer science to urban design. How could I have imagined at that time that I would continue to study computer science now? :-)</p>
<p>Now, I am interested in database systems and system programming. Also, I am a participant in <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a> with <a href="https://github.com/MariaDB/">MariaDB</a> in 2022. It is a good opportunity to become part of the open-source community and extend my knowledge of programming.</p>
