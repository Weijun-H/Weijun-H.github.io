      <description>Overview In this week, I finished the design of regression function, and implemented most part of them. Basically, the implementation of window can be completed at the same, but the tests still need to be verified.
Design The core part of these functions is how to accumulate the value instead of calculating at the end of process. I adopted the Welford&amp;rsquo;s online algorithm and implement it in Regr_transition class. Then all of Item_sum_regr_XXX will use it to get the value by invoking individual bool val_real().</description>

      <description>Overview My task is to implement regression functions in MariaDB, which was mentioned in MDEV-17467. This feature has been implemented by many MariaDB competitors, like PostgreSQL, Oracle, and so on.
Tasks The functions I need to implement are following:
 REGR_SLOPE: Returns the slope, equal to REGR_SXY / REGR_SYY REGR_INTERCEPT: Returns the y-intercept of the regression line, which is equal to REGR_AVGX - REGR_SLOPE * REGR_AVGY REGR_COUNT: Returns the number of non-empty pairs of numbers used to fill the regression line REGR_R2: The return value is equal to (REGR_SXY * REGR_SXY) / (REGR_SYY * REGR_SXX) REGR_AVGX: calculate the mean of the independent variable (expr2) of the regression line, after removing the null pair (expr1, expr2), is equal to AVG(expr2) REGR_AVGY: Calculate the mean of the strain variable (expr1) of the regression line, after removing the null pair (expr1, expr2), which is equal to AVG(expr1) REGR_SXX: The return value is equal to REGR_COUNT * VAR_POP(expr2) REGR_SYY: The return value is equal to REGR_COUNT * VAR_POP(expr1) REGR_SXY: The return value is equal to REGR_COUNT * COVAR_POP(expr1, expr2)  Mechanism How to define a function in MariaDB For native functions, it is easy to define.</description>

      <description>Hi there, my name is Weijun Huang. I am a master student at Technical University of Denmark (DTU), majoring in Human-centered Artificial Intelligence.
Life is like a circle. When I was a freshman, I thought my interest was design, and I had to work hard to switch from computer science to urban design. How could I have imagined at that time that I would continue to study computer science now? :-)</description>
