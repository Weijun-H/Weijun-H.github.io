Hi there, my name is Weijun Huang. I am a master student at [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/english) (DTU), majoring in Human-centered Artificial Intelligence.

Life is like a circle. When I was a freshman, I thought my interest was design, and I had to work hard to switch from computer science to urban design. How could I have imagined at that time that I would continue to study computer science now? :-)

Now, I am interested in database systems and system programming. Also, I am a participant in [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) with [MariaDB](https://github.com/MariaDB/) in 2022. It is a good opportunity to become part of the open-source community and extend my knowledge of programming.
